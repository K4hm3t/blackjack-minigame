This is a JavaScript code for a simple implementation of a blackjack game.

The code starts by defining a function called generateDeck that creates a standard deck of 52 cards using two arrays, one for the suits and the other for the card values. The function then returns the deck.

The drawCard function takes a deck as input, randomly selects a card from it, removes it from the deck and returns the selected card.

The checkScore function takes a hand of cards as input, calculates the total score of the hand according to the rules of blackjack, and returns the total score.

The code then creates a deck using the generateDeck function and initializes the player's and dealer's hands with two cards each. It then prints the starting hands and scores.

The game is played using a while loop that continues until one of the players wins or loses. In each iteration of the loop, the player draws a card, the player's and dealer's scores are calculated, and the game checks if the player or dealer has won or lost. If so, the loop is broken, and the game ends.

Finally, the code prints the ending hands and scores of both the player and the dealer.


To run this program, you need to copy the entire JavaScript code into a JavaScript file (for example, blackjack.js), save the file, and then open it using a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js or a web browser console.

If you're using Node.js, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the blackjack.js file is saved, and type node blackjack.js to execute the program.

If you're using a web browser console, open your browser and open the console (usually by pressing F12). Then, create a new script in the console and copy-paste the entire JavaScript code into it. Press Enter to run the code.
